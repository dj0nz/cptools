## My private Check Point knowledge base ##

I use these scripts at work and wanted to make them public available. Maybe some of you can benefit from them. 
That would make me very happy. Feel free to contact me if you find any serious mistakes.

### [add-gw-hostnames.sh](add-gw-hostnames.sh)
Uses mgmt_cli to fetch names and IPs of gateways or cluster members from Check Point database and creates host name entries. 

### [backup-gaia-mgmt.sh](backup-gaia-mgmt.sh)
Enhanced management server backup. Does backup AND export, adds version info, gaia config and some directories to a tgz and copies the bundle using scp to a given backup server.

### [check_ssl_ciphers.sh](check_ssl_ciphers.sh)
Uses cpopenssl to quick-check ciphers on a given IP address

### [create_broadcast_objects.sh](create_broadcast_objects.sh)
Ever had to create a network group containing broadcast objects on a gateway with 100+ VLAN interfaces? This is for you. ;)

### [grid-import.sh](grid-import.sh)
Get networks from Infoblox Grid Containers and create corresponding network objects in Check Point database. Uses REST API calls. Sort of POC.

### [gw-config-backup.sh](gw-config-backup.sh)
Small script that runs on Check Point management server. Uses cprid_util to get Gaia config from all managed gateways and store the locally. Use together with the backup-gaia-mgmt script to have an almost complete backup of your Check Point environment.

### [logwork.sh](logwork.sh)
The Logwork Orange (“Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?” - Anthony Burgess, A Clockwork Orange) script deletes old log files. Check Point version and retention time adjustable.

### [topocalc.sh](topocalc.sh)
Quick-Check cluster topology.

### [move-to-bond.sh](move-to-bond.sh)
Move existing VLAN interface from any eth (bond, tun, whatever) to a newly created bond interface. Avoids copy-paste-issues.
