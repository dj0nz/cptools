# Backup a Check Point Management Server running on a Proxmox VE host
#
# Check Point currently doesn't have QEMU/KVM guest utilities activated. Doing backups while the
# system is running may wreak havoc to filesystems and/or backups. This script does a manual shutdown
# of the management server processes (cpstop), stops the vm and creates a backup if all this shutdown stuff completed successfully.
#
# Parameters:
# MGMT_VMID: The VM ID of the Management Server VM
# MGMT_NAME: Hostname of the Mangement Server
# CPSTOP_TIMEOUT: Time limit for the cpstop command. Maybe more time needed for larger deployments
# SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT: Time limit for the shutdown command (seconds). Maybe more time needed for larger deployments
# STORAGE: The storage location for backups (pbs, cifs, cephfs etc.). List with "pvesm status"
# KEEP: The number of backups to retain
# LOGFILE: Guess what this is (output goes there)
#
# Requirements:
# - Check Point Management VM ssh port must be reachable from the Proxmox Host itself
# - Configure pubkey auth between PVE host and Check Point Management VM
# - Backup storage must already be set up and usable
