# Purpose:
# Read networks from Infoblox IPAM network containers, search for comment fields that start with a certain pattern.
# Store filtered networks and comments to a file and use this file to create the corresponding objects in the Check Point database.
#
# Variables or settings you might want to adjust:
# - $GRID_IP: The IP address of your Infoblox Grid
# - $GRID_CONTAINERS: Infoblox Network Container "Names"
# - $PATTERN: Search pattern to filter networks based on comments field content
# - $OUTPUT: Output file. Contains comments and networks in csv format.
# - $CP_API_KEY_ENC: Encrypted file that contains Check Point API key
# - $GRID_CREDS: Encrypted file that contains Infoblox credentials (netrc format)
# - $CP_MGMT: Ip address of Check Point Management server (or domain)
# - $NET_GROUP: Name of the network group in Check Point database where the networks should be added to
#
# Also, you might want to change the naming template for the network objects created in the CP database, which currently is "net_$NETWORK_24".
# And BTW networks created are always /24. If you want to change that, you may use the $NETMASK variable which is also extracted from the
# CSV file the Infoblox WAPI call created. Don't forget to change naming template accordingly if you do so.
#
# Script can be run from any system with a bash shell that is authorized for API access to both (Check Point / Infoblox) management systems.
# It is NOT intended to be run unattended, because it needs user input (passphrase to decrypt Checkpoint API key and Grid credentials).
#
# Of course, these files must have been encrypted beforehand (using gpg -c). Don't store them unencrypted!
# You may also use encryption tools like gocryptfs but you will have to trust the superuser then if you're working on a multiuser system.
#
# One more thing: This script is not intended to be run as root.
#

# -- Black Mesa Announcement System
#
# Software needed locally:
# - gpg to (optionally) store API key and credentials in a safe(er) manner
# - jq to parse Json outputs
# - curl for http access
#
# Requirements:
# - An Infoblox Grid or standalone IPAM system with current software release (> 8.5) and a user with appropriate (read) permissions
# - A Check Point Management System with current software release (R81.x) and an API user there with Read/Write permissions
# - Appropriate access rules (allow https) on the firewalls protecting the management systems
