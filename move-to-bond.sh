# Move existing VLANs from current configuration to new bond interface. IP and netmask are retained.
# To modify firewall topology in management database, see move-to-bond-mgmt.sh 
#
# Things to check / change:
# - $BOND  : New bonding group that will get created. Make sure it doesn't exist.
# - SLAVES : Slave interface in the new bonding group. Make sure they are really unused.
# - VLANS  : VLANs on other interfaces that should be transferred to the bond. No questions asked.
#
# Final notice: 
# Only run the deployment command (clish -f ...) if you checked all requirements AND if you know what you're doing...
